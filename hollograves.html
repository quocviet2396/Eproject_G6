                <br>
                <p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">The house first opened in 1995 as a Halloween attraction at the Gingerbread Castle in Hamburg, NJ.
                    After additional Halloween runs in Wayne and Andover, the house made the change to a shore
                    attraction with its debut at Keansburg Amusement Park in 2002. After that one season, it moved to
                    the Seaside Heights in 2003. After four seasons, the house returned to its Halloween roots with
                    seasons in Vernon and Budd Lake from 2007 through 2010. In 2012, the Haunted Manor returned to
                    Seaside Heights. A long term stay was made impossible though when Hurricane Sandy ravaged the
                    boardwalk, destroying just about everything on it. Somehow, the Haunted Manor was one of very few
                    attractions to make it through the storm completely intact and, in 2013, it relocated back to
                    Keansburg Amusement Park in Keansburg, NJ where we plan to keep it for the foreseeable future!</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, the Haunted Manor is family friendly. While there are definitely some bloody
                    scenes inside, we pride ourselves on creepiness over excessive gore. It is much more in the vein of
                    a classic haunted house attraction with a mixture of live actors and one of a kind animatronic
                    characters that you will find nowhere else!
